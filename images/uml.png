 -A,--no-antialias          Turns anti-aliasing off.
 -d,--debug                 Renders the debug grid over the resulting
                            image.
 -E,--no-separation         Prevents the separation of common edges of
                            shapes.
 -e,--encoding <ENCODING>   The encoding of the input file.
 -h,--html                  In this case the input is an HTML file. The
                            contents of the <pre class="textdiagram"> tags
                            are rendered as diagrams and saved in the
                            images directory and a new HTML file is
                            produced with the appropriate <img> tags.
    --help                  Prints usage help.
 -o,--overwrite             If the filename of the destination image
                            already exists, an alternative name is chosen.
                            If the overwrite option is selected, the image
                            file is instead overwriten.
 -r,--round-corners         Causes all corners to be rendered as round
                            corners.
 -S,--no-shadows            Turns off the drop-shadow effect.
 -s,--scale <SCALE>         A natural number that determines the size of
                            the rendered image. The units are fractions of
                            the default size (2.5 renders 1.5 times bigger
                            than the default).
 -t,--tabs <TABS>           Tabs are normally interpreted as 8 spaces but
                            it is possible to change that using this
                            option. It is not advisable to use tabs in
                            your diagrams.
 -v,--verbose               Makes ditaa more verbose.
